# Multimodal Fake News Detection Using Ensemble Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news across multiple modalities (text, image) using ensemble learning techniques. By combining predictions from different models, we aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of fake news detection.
With the rapid spread of misinformation across various platforms, multi-modal fake news detection aims to tackle the challenge by analyzing both textual and visual content. Our approach uses ensemble learning to enhance prediction accuracy by combining the strengths of different models.
This project is suitable for applications in social media monitoring, journalism, and content moderation.

## Features
Multi-modal analysis: Uses both text and images for fake news detection.
Ensemble Learning: Combines outputs from multiple models, including CNN and NLP-based models.
Scalable and extensible architecture: Easily adaptable to other datasets and modalities.
Pre-trained models support: Utilizes pre-trained embeddings and transfer learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of multimodal data, including:

- **Text**: News articles labeled as real or fake.
- **Images**: Associated image Url's.

## Methodology

The detection process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess text, images.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from each modality.
3. **Model Training**: Train individual models for each modality.
4. **Ensemble Learning**: Combine predictions from different models to improve accuracy.

## Results

The performance of the ensemble model will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
